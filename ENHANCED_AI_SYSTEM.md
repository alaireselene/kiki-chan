# Enhanced AI-Driven Kiki-chan System

## What's New

The system now features **AI-driven chain-of-thought analysis** where the AI analyzes every message and makes intelligent decisions about:

1. **Message Quality Assessment**: ENGAGING/BORING/VIOLATING
2. **Charisma Changes**: Mathematical formulas with dampening
3. **Action Selection**: REACT/REPLY/CHAT/VOTE/NO_RESPONSE
4. **Behavioral Adaptations**: Based on user's current charisma and history

## Key Features

### ðŸ§  AI Chain-of-Thought Analysis
The AI now analyzes each message with:
```
**ANALYSIS:**
- Message Quality: ENGAGING (thoughtful question with appreciation)
- Reason: User asked meaningful question and said "please"
- Base Charisma Change: +3
- Applied Formula: 3 * (1 - 45/150) * (1 - 12/200) = +2.2 â†’ +2
- Final Charisma Change: +2
- Current User State: Medium charisma, friendly interaction
- Chosen Action: REPLY

**CHARISMA:** +2
yo that's actually a really good question! ðŸŒŸ let me break it down for u...
```

### ðŸŽ­ Smart Action Selection
- **REACT**: Simple emoji acknowledgment
- **REPLY**: Direct response to user
- **CHAT**: Casual conversation without reply
- **VOTE**: Community decision polls
- **NO_RESPONSE**: Silent treatment for low charisma/violations

### ðŸš« "Shut Up" Protocol
If user tells Kiki to shut up:
1. Mark as VIOLATING (-10 charisma)
2. Apply heavy charisma penalty
3. Only respond when directly mentioned or user begs
4. Gradual relationship rebuilding

### ðŸ“Š Enhanced Charisma System
- **Mathematical dampening**: Prevents abuse with realistic scaling
- **Context awareness**: Considers total interactions and current charisma
- **Behavioral adaptation**: Response style changes based on relationship
